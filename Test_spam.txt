Hi guys I want to build a website like REDACTED and I wanted to get your perspective of whether that site is good from the users' perspective before I go ahead and build something similar. I think that the design of the site is very modern and nice but I am not sure how people would react to a similar site? I look forward to your feedback. Many thanks!
